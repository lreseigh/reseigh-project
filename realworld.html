				<h3 id= "client-name">TARGUSinfo</h3>

				<p id="project-copy">TARGUS info had never previously created a companywide campaign, so the CMO tasked me with the job. The Real World of Marketing campaign showed prospects and customers that the company understood their real problems and multiple solutions were available across their internal verticals.
				</p>

				<p id="project-copy">An imaginary team was created to show customers how their own problems could be solved. The team included the CEO, CMO, Marketing Manager, VP of Acquisition and Director of Sales. Custom photography was shot and stories were created to work individually and as a team, just like the real world.

				</p>

				<p id="project-copy"> The campaign ran for one year and was used across all sales verticals and marketing channels. Messaging was created from the collaboration from the creative, marketing, product and sales teams.
