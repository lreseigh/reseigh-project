			<h2 id="project-name">We Love Our Customers campaign</h2>
				
			<h3 id= "client-name">TARGUSinfo</h3>

			<p id="project-copy">Customers considered the insight they received from TARGUSinfo was their secret sauce, so they were hesitant about case studies. One way to tout large retail customers without them having to give up their recipes for success was a campaign focusing on how TARGUSinfo loved their customers. This campaign focused on giving away gift certificates from big name clients such as, Ace Hardware, Best Buy, Crate & Barrel, Office Depot, PayPal and Zappos at a few select events.</p>

			<p id="project-copy">Once the clients agreed to be featured, idea of using Zappos shipping boxes came to life. High impact mailers (with low costs) were shipped a pre-show mailers to top prospect attendees. The idea being, the recipient receives a Zappos box and is intrigued by the package since they didn’t remember ordering shoes. Inside is a piece with an image of shoes inside a box and all the information needed about TARGUSinfo’s information and giveaway at the events. Two versions were created with women’s and men’s’ shoes to specifically target gender.</p> 

			<p id="project-copy">Clients loved the shoutout and free advertising while prospects thought the idea was clever and memorable. The sales team at the events had increased visitors to the space at the event, which helped move conversations towards sales.</p>
